## Directions on the Route

Filter by direction of travel along the route. Must be used in conjuction with filter[route] to apply.

The meaning of direction_id varies based on the route. You can programmatically get the direction names from `/routes /data/{index}/attributes/direction_names` or `/routes/{id} /data/attributes/direction_names`

```
filter[direction_id]
